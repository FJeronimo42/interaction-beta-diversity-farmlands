ABSTRACT
Agriculture influences biodiversity through the intensification of land use and agricultural management. These impacts manifest at both the farm and landscape scales. They influ-ence not only species but also their interactions, which can compromise essential ecosys-tem services, such as pollination. In this research, we investigated how landscape features and agricultural management affect the composition of crop-pollinator interactions in smallholder polycultures. We sampled interactions between crops and bees on 13 farms. From these interactions, we derived interaction β-diversity indices (βWN: interaction β-diversity, βST: interaction β-diversity due species turnover, βOS: interaction β-diversity due interaction rewiring, and βPoll: interaction β-diversity due pollinator turnover) based on the dissimilarity of farm networks relative to the regional interaction pool. For these farms, we generated variables for landscape structure and forest configuration at the landscape scale, and farm complexity and crop heterogeneity at the farm scale. We tested the effects of these four variables on the β-diversity indices using generalised linear model selection. We found that farm complexity significantly affected βWN and βST, while crop heterogene-ity affected βST, βOS, and βPoll. Landscape structure influenced only βOS, whereas forest configuration had minimal effects on interaction dissimilarity βWN. Our findings demon-strate that the composition of interactions in smallholder polycultures is primarily deter-mined by management decisions made at the local scale. This highlights the farmer’s role in conserving interactions. This effect is particularly pronounced on dissimilarity arising from species turnover, especially pollinators. Integrating local and regional measures is essential for sustainable land management to conserve biodiversity and ensure food security.
